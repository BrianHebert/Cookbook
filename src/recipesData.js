                        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n" +
                        "1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour\n" +
                        "½ teaspoon baking soda\n" +
                        "4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks\n" +
                        "4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference\n",
                "preperation": "In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.\n" +
                                "Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.\n" +
                                "Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).\n" +
                                "Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.\n" +
                                "Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n" +
                                "Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.\n" +
                                "Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.\n" +
